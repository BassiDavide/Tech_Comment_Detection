Let them choose which ones they prefer to go to and then set up court hearings in or near the sanctuary cities they picked.

{"CommentID": "Comment_25bbfad7", "CommentText": "@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  \n\nThank you for responding Lupita - I'll gladly tell you where I got the information about the 40 Billion.  When doing research, I always consult more than just one source.  I'm giving you the links below to some of the articles so you can read them yourself.  Why did you say Fox News?  Is that the limit of your reach? I never get my research information from watching \ntelevision - I don't even own a TV - too much deliberately distorted information on mainstream news; I acquire all mine from independent sources online that are truth tellers.  Not sure where you got the notion I am naive - perhaps you need to direct that at yourself - after all, you didn't even know that staggering amount of money was going back to Mexico every year - I'm the one who had to tell you!   While I agree with you about \nspending money how one wants to, this situation is different  - it matters where you spend the money to a certain extent.  I am loyal to the economy where I earn my money - for a society to patronize each other's businesses \nwhere they all work serves to build up the neighborhood, each other, then finally the country.  It builds a \"sense of community\" too.  It's the way economies work.  If I moved to Mexico and had nothing and needed a job to survive I would be so grateful to get hired and when I got paid I would show my appreciation by patronizing the local businesses.  It's how you assimilate and fit in.  It's the theory of giving back after you've been given to. One more thing: you said \"their working conditions are not the greatest.\"  I thought they came to America for work - and they certainly can leave \nto go work at a place that's better.  Why didn't they just stay in Mexico and work there, then?  That's a pretty offensive thing you said - I've done plenty of jobs in my lifetime that weren't the greatest - but I was grateful to get the job so I didn't complain. The same excuse you used that they do a job nobody wants simply isn't true.  That's the same old narrative I'm guessing you got from television.  I guess that's what you meant when you said Fox News - that must be what you watch.  Another thing:  as you will learn when you read the articles, many of the immigrants that come here get financial support till they get on their feet - we give them welfare, food, \na job - and then the money they earn from the job we gave them, they send to another country to support the economy there?

No ifs, ands or buts about it, the Biden Administration is failing to secure our southern borders, would you agree?

Do you fucking know how hard the US govt has made even legal immigration? There have been so many stories about this.

Do any of you know how fucking hard US govt has made even the asylum process (this is people fleeing for their lives because their lives are in danger. But the US govt is heartless, the laws are super unfair if you're brown and an immigrant. It's not the same if you're a white immigrant. The short answer is America is very very racist in the way it treats immigrants, the laws are not applied equally and are very much arbitrary. ICE are fucking horrible and should have been dismantled, separating kids from their parents is inhumane. And I keep hearing this racist rhetoric from white people who themselves came from Europe as immigrants and took over Native American lands. HAVE SOME COMPASSION FFS! \nAlso b) Drugs like Marijuana are already legalised in some states. Drugs aren't the issue, blaming the kid or his mother isn't the issue! BLAME ICE! Blame FUCKING US GOVT (Donald Trump and his evil cronies who have made the entire process of immigration almost impossible, and it was already very very hard even in Obama's time). \nAnd have some compassion, god forbid you are in any position where you have to immigrate to a different country to save your life or to even better your life. No one is illegal, America is not at threat from a teenage boy who came here when he was 4 and has lived all his life here and has dreams and ambitions, same as everyone else. Policies are illegal, fucking call out the policies and the inhumane laws that designate human beings as legal and illegal. And then, you know, make the laws better.

It takes only 6 months for a fiance but they have more paperwork to complete and vetting once married. As a wife she was fully vetted and came with her permanent residency and SS card already in hand. A few months delay due to the Brunei Embassy, you have to get clearance from anywhere you lived in the last 10 years, asking for another payment. We then got 2 copies :).  I didn't need a lawyer but you can use them.A legal immigrant is sponsored for the first 2 years and any entitlement from governments they receive is to be paid back by that sponsor.They communicate well during the process about steps and status.

Do you honestly not get that the citizens of a particular country have a right to choose who they will, and will not allow to join them? If Mexico said they only wanted to let that Americans immigrate to their country that would be their prerogative. If South African said, they only wanted to let other Africans immigrate to their country that would be their prerogative. If England said, we only want to allow people under the age of 40 to immigrate to our country, that would be their prerogative. We don't have to like it because it's not our country, but every country has the right to self determination and to exist in whatever way they want to exist. We don't have to necessarily associate with them much we can decide not to trade with that much. If we don't like some thing they're doing but we can't dictate to anyone who they will, or won't allow to enter their country. In that same way, we have that seem right and if that means we want to choose to allow Cubans to have a special status with us, that's our prerogative and quite frankly, I think Cubans make some of our best immigrants ever because every Cuban I've ever encountered, whether I see them in an interview or whether I know them personally, they understand and value freedom in a way that a lot of us take for granted. They understand that Socialism completely failed their society and that it always leads to a degree of oppression, so they value all of the fundamental beliefs that our founding fathers integrated into our way of life. Most Cubans have a profound understanding of what makes our society so special, and they tend to have a very meaningful love for this country that I don't know we'll see from others.

I am a nurse and I save lives.  I live now in Germany.  I need a lawyer to file, with other disabled citizens of Ukraine, a lawsuit against Norway.  My husband, a Ukrainian (oil worker, human rights activist) became disabled as a result of his defense of the rights of other people (Norwegian and Russian media for 9 years).  My husband fought corruption in the Russian oil giant, which was headed by the founder of the 6th Directorate of the FSB and the ex-Chancellor of Germany.  My husband defended the rights of disabled people and Ukrainians in Norway against Russian-speaking citizens of this NATO country.  The Norwegians took my disabled husband to Moscow AFTER: anti-war pickets of my husband in the Russian Federation, his defense of the rights of Ukrainians in Norway, the issuance of documents to my husband by the Norwegian Red Cross for his close relatives (Polish servicemen repressed by the Russians), sentencing his defender to prison (in  married to a citizen of Finland for 25 years) in Belarus, who reported the crime of the Norwegians against the Ukrainians and was recognized as a Political prisoner.

The stranger who manhandled an innocent man, the Islamic prophet, at Hira cave and pressed him at least 3 times, without any provocation! \r\nWho was he? Did he reveal his identity or name? No, never. \r\nDid he claim he was angel Gabriel from God of Abraham? No, never. \r\nSee his mysterious behavior! Even a street bully won't press an innocent man without any provocation! \r\n\r\nEntire Islam is based on this one person, since Allah never interacted with humanity! Allah never spoke to any human being till today. No human ever seen him! Allah remains as a character inside the pages of Quran, the book that the Stranger brought! Did Allah carry out any activity in last 1400 years? If you know anything, please share.\r\n\r\n Any witness for above Stranger? No, none, till today. \r\n\r\n1.8 billion people follow this total Stranger! Without asking any questions. From very childhood asking questions are discouraged and blind faith is instilled in young minds. \r\n\r\nWhereas God of Bible forewarned and foretold about this Stranger well in advance! The Stranger who will directly stand against God Almighty's saving program for sinful humanity, that is, by sending His son in order to die on the cross of Calvary. \r\n\r\nNow, what was the most important mission our above total Stranger of Hira cave had? \r\n\r\n1. Deny Jesus as Son of God Almighty. Declare boldly that Allah got no son! Declare that saying Allah got a son is the greatest sin! \r\n\r\n2. Deny God of Bible's second program: deny Jesus died on cross of Calvary. Say the ultimate falsehood, that some one else died on cross! \r\n\r\n3. In short blind the eyes of humanity to God Almighty's saving program and generate doubts about it in human mind! That is the declared mission of Islam. \r\n\r\n4. Stand against Ten Commandments God Almighty Himself declared on Mount Sinai! Encourage the Islamic prophet to brake the Ten Commandments!\r\n\r\nThe Stranger of Hira cave, the real person behind Islamic religion, spoke directly against what the Real angel Gabriel of Bible spoke to Mary, the future mother of Jesus Christ. See below please.\r\n Luke 1: 30 And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. 31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, 33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” 34 And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?” 35 And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God. 36 And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. 37 For nothing will be impossible with God.” 38 And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.\r\n\r\nIn Quran we do not know the real identity of the Stranger! Whereas Bible forewarned about him as below, well in advance! \r\n\r\n1 John 2: 22 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that he made to us—eternal life. 26 I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you.\r\n\r\n2 Corinthians 11: 4 For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. \r\n\r\nIslam spoke about another Jesus- Issa! \r\n\r\nIslam spoke about yet another spirit -- the so called Jibreel, spirit of Allah!\r\n\r\n2 Corinthians 11: 14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. \r\n\r\nJohn 3: 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. 36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.\r\n\r\nGalatians 1:6-9 No Other Gospel 6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— 7 not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.", "annotations": [{"technique": "thought-terminating cliché", "start": 22, "end": 38, "text_span": "Great Deception!"}, {"technique": "black-and-white fallacy", "start": 40, "end": 129, "text_span": "Every Christian and Muslim need to study both the Books (Bible and Quran) very carefully."}, {"technique": "reductio ad hitlerum", "start": 133, "end": 332, "text_span": "Islam depends on the words of one person, one total Stranger!

If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that he made to us—eternal life. 26 I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you.\r\n\r\n2 Corinthians 11: 4 For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough."}, {"technique": "appeal to authority", "start": 4310, "end": 5166, "text_span": "2 Corinthians 11: 14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. \r\n\r\nJohn 3: 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. 36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.\r\n\r\nGalatians 1:6-9 No Other Gospel 6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— 7 not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. 8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed."}]}
